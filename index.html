                    In our full-stack project, collaborating within a team environment was invaluable, enhancing my
                    skills beyond coding. Working alongside teammates underscored the importance of effective
                    communication and teamwork in achieving our goals.

                    Implementing user authentication and registration functionalities was pivotal. This involved delving
                    into login systems, authentication protocols, and data security, emphasizing the significance of
                    user privacy in web applications.

                    Additionally, our project introduced Agile and Scrum frameworks, aiding in task breakdown and
                    prioritization based on feedback. Daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives ensured
                    organization and adaptability throughout development, culminating in an early project completion.

                            Started by washing and preparing ingredients, which gradually improved efficiency in
                            preparation and closing procedures. Throughout my time, I actively engaged in teamwork,
                            collaborating with colleagues to ensure smooth operations. I also took the initiative to
                            learn various roles such as line worker, grill operator, fryer, and cashier over a period of
                            six months. As I gained proficiency in each role, I willingly shared my knowledge with new
                            hires, providing guidance and support to help them integrate into the team effectively.
                            Additionally, I demonstrated a proactive approach to problem-solving, both independently and
                            by seeking assistance when necessary, fostering a positive and supportive work environment.

                        Assisted both professors and fellow students by offering support in various capacities. Engaged
                        in one-on-one and group discussions to address questions and tackle challenges encountered
                        during class sessions. Additionally, I had the opportunity to lead a class session, enhancing my
                        communication skills and fostering leadership abilities. This experience provided valuable
                        insights into problem-solving from diverse perspectives. Recognizing the unique backgrounds and
                        learning styles of individuals, I learned the importance of understanding their perspectives as
                        a leader or mentor, enabling me to adapt and effectively support their needs.
